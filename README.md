# Diabetes-Prediction-using-CART-Decision-Tree
This project involves building a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model to predict diabetes based on various health-related attributes such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and more. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, the data is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and a decision tree model is developed using the rpart package in R. The model's performance is evaluated through a confusion matrix to assess its accuracy and diagnostic capability. Additionally, the most influential features contributing to the prediction are identified and visualized. This project offers a hands-on introduction to decision tree-based classification in R, with a practical focus on predicting binary health outcomes.
